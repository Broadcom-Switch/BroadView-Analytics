Discovering and Registering BroadView Switches
==============================================

BroadView switches are capable of sending auto-registration messages to the configured BroadView Analytics application. Once the application receives auto-registration messages from the switch, the application automatically registers that switch for monitoring. Automatically registered switches also get added under the BroadView Switches root node.
